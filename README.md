## Hi there 👋

### 📌 Project 1: Toastmasters RAG System

**Problem:**  
Toastmasters members often struggle to find accurate, up-to-date information scattered across multiple documents such as pathways, roles, and club processes.

**What I built:**  
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides document-grounded answers, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations in responses.

**Key features:**
- Three-stage pipeline: Ingestion → Retrieval & Generation → Evaluation  
- Query classification for improved retrieval routing  
- Metadata-driven filtering to narrow search scope  
- Reranking to improve relevance of retrieved documents  

**Tech:** Python, LLMs, RAG, Vector Search

### 📌 Project 2: ML Foundations

**Goal:**  
Develop strong intuition for data behavior, predictive modeling, and generalization through hands-on implementation of core ML techniques and exploratory analysis.

**What I worked on:**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (NYC Taxi Dataset):**  
  Analyzed large-scale trip data to uncover financial and temporal patterns.  
  - Data preparation: sampling, cleaning, preprocessing  
  - Analysis: revenue trends, peak demand hours, seasonal effects  
  - Insights: operational and business strategies to optimize profitability  

- **Linear Regression (Car Price Prediction):**  
  Built predictive models for car prices and studied the effect of regularisation.  
  - Applied Ridge and Lasso to handle multicollinearity  
  - Used regularisation for feature selection and improved generalization  

- **Logistic Regression (Employee Attrition Prediction):**  
  Modeled employee attrition as a classification problem.  
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection  
  - Model training and evaluation  
  - Intuitive data visualisations to interpret predictions and decision boundaries  

**Focus areas:**
- Bias–variance trade-off and overfitting  
- Role of regularisation in controlling model complexity  
- Translating data patterns into interpretable insights  
- Using data visualisation as a reasoning and diagnostic tool  

**Tech:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
